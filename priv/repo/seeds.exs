# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     DraftGuru.Repo.insert!(%DraftGuru.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

defmodule DraftCombineStatsSeed do
  
  # use the data loading module
  # use the Context for the Players
  use 
end
